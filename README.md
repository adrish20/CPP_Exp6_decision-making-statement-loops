<h1>Theory</h1>
<p>In C++, loops are control structures which allow the block of code to be repeated so that the statement or group of statements can be executed one or more times. The `for` loop uses a counter that specifies the number of times it is to be used, `while` loop runs until the condition is met and `do-while` loop, which runs the block at least once before testing the condition. These looping structures are also useful to allow code to be as automated as possible which is more optimized compared to having to write out the same processes repeatedly.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, it is possible to state that decision-making statements and loops are significant for C++ application development to build more adjustable and productive programs.</p>
